## Champlaron

>![[Champlaron IMG.png]]


Champlaron is a land that once thrived in harmony and magic. Its capital city, Hiroe, was renowned for its integration of magic into everyday life. However, peace was shattered by the arrival of a mysterious figure named Barda, whose motives remain unknown. Barda's destructive presence caused widespread devastation, destroying villages and rendering the once-fertile land barren.

The most catastrophic event, known as Barda's Blight, occurred when Hiroe, the crown jewel of Champlaron, was completely destroyed. It took the efforts of a hero named Bearmane to end Barda's rampage. Bearmane, guided by divine intervention, delivered a fatal blow to Barda, ending the Blight.

The aftermath of Barda's Blight led to significant changes in Champlaron. With major cities in ruins, Bearmane established his own village as the new capital and initiated a massive reconstruction effort. However, a division arose among the population. The "dark races" were deemed enemies of the Sanctified and were subsequently exiled to the forsaken lands east and south of the Triton Mountains. These exiles, known as The Forgotten, faced immense challenges as they sought survival and sought revenge against the ruling powers.

As Champlaron rebuilds, scars from Barda's devastation remain. The land is marked by a struggle for power and survival between the Sanctified and The Forgotten.
