It boasts the continent's most prestigious university and advanced infrastructure, surpassing even the capital city in terms of development. The city's reliance on magic is apparent in every aspect of life, with residents being taught magic from a young age. Poppleton is a bustling hub of activity, with students studying late into the night and daily displays of awe-inspiring magic.

>Under the nominal rule of King Hawthorn IV, the city is technically governed by a council of wise magic users who advise the duke. However, some dissidents within the city believe that Poppleton should be independent, given its abundant magical resources and capabilities. Tensions have been mounting as the presence of crown soldiers grows, reflecting the escalating debate between those advocating for autonomy and those supporting the king's authority.

>Poppleton's history began as a small settlement of wandering magic users who recognized its favorable location for their purposes. Over time, the settlement grew into a thriving city, attracting more magic users and their families. The city endured a devastating attack during Barda's Blight, but the resilient survivors banded together to rebuild their beloved Poppleton. The Assembly of the Wise was established to advise the duke, ensuring that the city would never be caught off guard again.

>Poppleton's calendar comprises five days per week and ten months per year, each month containing six weeks. Each day of the week holds significance, ranging from reflection and enlightenment to rest and exploration. While no longer legally mandated, the rituals associated with these days remain deeply ingrained in the city's culture.
